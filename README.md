Orabbix 
=======

Product Description
-------------------

Orabbix is a plugin designed to work with Zabbix Enterprise Monitor to provide multi-tiered monitoring, performance and availability reporting and measurement for Oracle Databases, along with server performance metrics.

It provides an effective mechanism to acquire data from numerous Oracle instances, and in turn provides this information for monitoring and performance metrics to your Zabbix server. You can then utilise the reporting capabilities of Zabbix for all data collected, and provide analysis such as graphs and service level agreement metrics for stakeholders.

The current distribution contains a set of pre-defined templates which incorporate alerting and graphing capabilities from initial deployment. However these can be fine tuned to suit your needs and data/monitoring requirements.
